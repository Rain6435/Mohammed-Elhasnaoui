Welcome.


This software is written in C++. 

The purpose of this software is to manage a school at a very simple level. You will understand why.
The software is divided in three departements and each departement has his own rights toward some software elements, mainly students, courses and notes.
A student can register himself or see his notes.
A teacher can search a student or add notes to a student.
An administrator can do basically everything, but not really. He can search a student, create one(register one), display a student's notes, create a course, display all the notes or all the notes of a particular student, which is executed by creating a text file, writing in it and displaying it. he can also display all the students and all the courses.

That's it. 

Have fun using it!!!
